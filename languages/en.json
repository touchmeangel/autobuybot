  "qa": "❓ <b>Q</b>: <i>How do I deposit stars into the bot?</i>\n❗ A: The bot is designed to handle your gift balance automatically—you don't need to manage star deposits yourself. We've implemented strict internal limits to keep everything secure and running smoothly. Just choose the gift option you want, and the system takes care of the rest.\n\n❓ <b>Q</b>: <i>I've connected my account, but nothing is showing up in my sessions. What should I do?</i>\n❗ <b>A</b>: <i>No worries—sometimes the session doesn't appear right away. Just try refreshing your browser or app screen, and the session should appear under your profile shortly.</i>\n\n❓ <b>Q</b>: <i>Is this a scam?</i>\n❗ <b>A</b>: <i>No — the service is automated and built to protect both buyers and sellers.</i> <b>That said, always exercise caution online</b>:\n- We use automated bot processes to complete transactions (no in-person handoffs), and we enforce limits and protections to reduce abuse.\n- If anything looks suspicious or you feel something isn't right, stop the transaction and contact support immediately\n- If you want extra assurance, check other users' feedback or ask support for verification steps before making a large deposit.",
